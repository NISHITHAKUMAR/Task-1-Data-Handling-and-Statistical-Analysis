Overview
a. Data Analysis and Statistics: Assessing the ability to analyse and interpret complex data, particularly phased methylation patterns.
b. NGS Alignment and Mutation Calling: Evaluating proficiency in processing raw sequencing data, aligning reads to a reference genome, and identifying somatic mutations.

Task 1: Data Handling and Statistical Analysis
Background: CpG methylation is an epigenetic marker that varies across tissue types.
However, the methylation status of a single CpG site is unreliable as a biomarker due to
errors introduced by bisulfite sequencing, sampling techniques, and biological variability.
Definition: Phased Methylation Pattern (PMP) is a unique set of coordinates that includes the DNA strand (‘f’ for forward (+) or ‘r’ for reverse (-)), the relative positions of three CpG sites on the same strand (e.g., x:y:z), and their methylation status (e.g., ‘000’ for all
unmethylated or ‘111’ for all methylated). It represents a combined epigenetic signature across these CpG sites.
Hypothesis: Phased methylation patterns (PMPs) can act as reliable biomarkers to
differentiate tissue types, providing higher specificity compared to individual CpG sites.
Dataset: The dataset (Link to Data) summarizes phased methylation patterns from NGS results across two tissues. Key columns include:
•	Strand: Indicates the DNA strand (‘f’ or ‘r’).
 
•	CpG Coordinates: Relative positions of three CpG sites (x:y:z).
•	Methylation Status: Eight possible patterns (‘000’ to ‘111’).
•	Sample ID: Unique identifier for each sample.
•	Replicate: Indicates technical replicates.
•	Tissue: Tissue type (Tissue #1 or Tissue #2). Sub-tasks:
1.	Coverage Analysis
a.	Calculate the median and coefficient of variation (CV) for single CpG coverage in each tissue.
b.	Generate plots summarizing the coverage statistics 
2.	Biomarker Identification 
a.	Identify PMPs with high specificity for tissue differentiation, minimizing false positives for Tissue #1 while allowing some false negatives. Use statistical or machine learning approaches to assign confidence (e.g., p-values) to each PMP
b.	Calculate the mean variant read fraction (VRF) for each PMP in both tissues. 
3.	Address the following questions 
a.	How does sequencing depth affect specificity confidence? 
b.	For the top 10 PMPs, estimate the threshold of reads required to confidently call Tissue #2 at a sequencing depth of 1 million reads. 
c.	Validate the hypothesis by comparing the specificity of the top 10 PMPs against individual CpG sites.
